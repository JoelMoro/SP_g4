"My name is Surita B and this is my diary. My day started
like any other day, I..."
The first thing I did this morning was to have milk and cereal for breakfast. Then I went to the gym and had lunch with my family. In the evening I'll go out with my friends as it's a party in my village.
I woke up in the morning and had a cup of tea while delivering SP assignment. After lunch, I had an appoinment with my PI in order to arrange the last figures for the paper. At night, I had dinner with my friends in the new local of the neighborhood
