My name is Surita B and this is my diary. My day started
like any other day, I...
I got up early for breakfast as I had a race near my house today. After a while my friend came to pick me up and we went to the race together. Everything went well, good weather and good company.
In the afternoon I watched a film on TV but fell asleep. I woke up in the evening just in time to eat something and go to bed.
The first thing I did this morning was to have milk and cereal for breakfast. Then I went to the gym and had lunch with my family. In the evening I'll go out with my friends as it's a party in my village.
I woke up in the morning and had a cup of tea while delivering SP assignment. After lunch, I had an appoinment with my PI in order to arrange the last figures for the paper. At night, I had dinner with my friends in the new local of the neighborhood
